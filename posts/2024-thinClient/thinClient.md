# Thin Client Experimentation

So a friend of mine came across some HP Thin Clients that were being disposed of, and managed to salvage a few before they were removed, with permission.

This is the saga of messing with those boxes.


## Box

The boxes are `HP t310 Copper NIC Zero Client` devices, which a quick google reveals that they are running `teradici TERA2321` processors with 256MB of SPI flash and 512MB of DDR3 RAM. Thin indeed.

Comes with the usual ports and ethernets etc, running off 12V3A power.

## Internals

Who doesn't love a quick diassembly first up? The box didn't have screws, so prying was the way forward. Taking the top panel off didn't reveal anything, and the bottom pannel appeared stuck. Scratching around on the bottom label reveals two screws under, which once pierced and undone, allows the bottom panel to come free. Two more screws later, the box can be slid apart, revealing the internals.

Hello! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This is a little test website/blog to document my random thoughts/experiments, both for your viewing/enjoyment, but also for me to look back on in the future.

I'm a university student studying _nerd_ subjects, and have an interest in such.

My current preferred shell is [zsh on wsl](posts/shell.md) on a [Framework Laptop](posts/frameworkLaptop/frameworkLaptop.md).

I [have mild regrets](posts/s23bloat.md) using a Samsung S23.

I'm a datahoarder, with a 18TB storage server running on TrueNAS Scale (5x4TB raidz1 + 2x2TB mirror).

I run a compute server which hosts [Pandora](posts/pandora.md), PiHole, a vpn node, and occasionally minecraft servers.

I've also written a very basic, poorly implemented, [Rocket Flight Computer](https://github.com/Cubie87/L2RocketSoftware) using the Arduino IDE on a Teensy board to log data for a Tripoli Level 2 Certification Flight.

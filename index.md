# Cubie's Github Pages

Hello! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This is a little test website/blog to document my random thoughts/experiments, both for your viewing/enjoyment, but also for me to look back on in the future.

My projects thus far include [Pandora](https://github.com/Cubie87/Pandora), a discord bot/personal assistant, and a very basic, poorly implemented, [Rocket Flight Computer](https://github.com/Cubie87/L2RocketSoftware) using the Arduino IDE on a Teensy board to log data for a Tripoli Level 2 Certification Flight.
